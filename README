1. The goal of the Winery application is to allow a user to favorite the wines they like from a directory. 
2. Deployment link: https://cautiouscat999.github.io/development/
3. I have a WineBottle component which easily lists the name, type, country, price, and image of the wines
that fit the search criteria. It uses the cart and price state as props in order to update them when the 
wines are added to the favorites list. 
4. For hierarchy, I wanted to keep everything vertical so that the user has an easy to follow path on the 
site. For layout, I kept everything centered and a set 50% of the screen width so that it's easily
adaptable to different screen sizes.
